## Search Engine

    Hi Guys, This is a search engine version 0. I am trying to build a search engine that connects to an API,
    it can filter by date and preview documents(extra feature wanted to provide), 
    such as pdf and excel on the web portal.
    it should also include did you mean, when your search keyword doesnot make sense to the API.
    Pagination shall also be provided due to below issues.
    Test case shall also be testing the return correct values of dateFn's functions.

# issues
    I stuck in the inter component state, when I choose and submit apply date filter,
    it suppose to change the dateRange state in searchContext, I am still investigating the issues.
    In addition, search input box does not prevent default behaviour, so that the search keyword 
    would disappear you press search, I am also looking for the solution. I suspect it is 
    due to re-render the searchBar item.




This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
